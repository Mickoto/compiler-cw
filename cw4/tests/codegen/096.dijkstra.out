Number of vertices: No. of neighbors for vertex 0: Neighbor no. 0: (index and weight, on separate lines)
Neighbor no. 1: (index and weight, on separate lines)
No. of neighbors for vertex 1: No. of neighbors for vertex 2: Neighbor no. 0: (index and weight, on separate lines)
Neighbor no. 1: (index and weight, on separate lines)
Confirming that the graph is:
0: 1 6, 2 3, 
1: 
2: 0 3, 1 2, 
Source and destination (on separate lines):
Shortest path from 0 to 1 has a weight of 5
Minimum spanning tree has cost: 5
